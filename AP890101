   The celluloid torch has been passed to a new
generation: filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s.
   ``Platoon,'' ``Running on Empty,'' ``1969'' and ``Mississippi
Burning'' are among the movies released in the past two years from
writers and directors who brought their own experiences of that
turbulent decade to the screen.
   ``The contemporaries of the '60s are some of the filmmakers of
the '80s. It's natural,'' said Robert Friedman, the senior vice
president of worldwide advertising and publicity at Warner Bros.
   Chris Gerolmo, who wrote the screenplay for ``Mississippi
Burning,'' noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and
others to express their feelings about the decade.
   ``Distance is important,'' he said. ``I believe there's a lot of
thinking about that time and America in general.''
   The Vietnam War was a defining experience for many people in the
'60s, shattering the consensus that the United States had a right,
even a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world. Even
today, politicians talk disparagingly of the ``Vietnam Syndrome'' in
referring to the country's reluctance to use military force to
settle disputes.
   ``I think future historians will talk about Vietnam as one of the
near destructions of American society,'' said Urie Brofenbrenner, a
professor of sociology at Cornell University.
   ``In World War II, we knew what we were fighting for, but not in
Vietnam.''
   ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Platoon,'' ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Hamburger Hill'' and ``Bat 21'' all use the
war as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters' lives.
   The Vietnam War has remained an emotional issue in the United
States as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their
experiences. One was Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the
Academy Award-winning ``Platoon.''
   ``I saw `Platoon' eight times,'' said John J. Anderson, a Palm
Beach County sheriff's lieutenant who served in Vietnam in 1966-67.
``I cried the first time I saw it ... and the third and fourth
times. `Platoon' helped me understand.''
   Stone, who based ``Platoon'' on some of his own experiences as a
grunt, said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved.
   ``People are responding to the fact that it's real. They're
curious about the war in Vietnam after 20 years,'' he said.
   While Southeast Asia was the pivotal foreign issue in American
society of the '60s, civil rights was the major domestic issue. The
civil rights movement reached its peak in the ``Freedom Summer'' of
1964, when large groups of volunteers headed South to help register
black voters.
   In ``Five Corners,'' a movie about the summer of '64 in the Bronx
starring Jodie Foster, her friend, played by Tim Robbins, leaves his
neighborhood to volunteer in the South after seeing the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on television.
   Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning'' focuses on an incident that
clouded the Mississippi Summer Project _ when 1,000 young volunteers
from mainstream America swept into the state to help register black
voters. The movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance
and slaying of three civil rights workers: Michael Schwerner, Andrew
Goodman and James Chaney.
   They were reported missing on June 21, several hours after being
stopped for speeding near Philadelphia, Miss. After a nationally
publicized search, their bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm
just outside the town.
   One of those who recalled the incident was Gerolmo, a student in
the New York public school system at the time. The screenwriter said
the incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking.
   ``It was the first time I ever considered that our country could
be wrong,'' Gerolmo said.
   The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman star as FBI agents
who try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome
fierce local resistance to solve the crime.
   In a more offbeat and outrageous way, John Waters' ``Hairspray''
discusses integration in Baltimore in 1963 when a group of
teen-agers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance
show.
   Also set in Baltimore is Barry Levinson's ``Tin Men,'' starring
Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding
salesmen in the early '60s. The movie mirrored a squarely
middle-class culture, one that was not caught up in sex, politics
and drugs.
   Instead of focusing on a well-known historic event,
writer-director Ernest Thompson takes a more personal approach in
``1969.'' Robert Downey Jr. and Keifer Sutherland star as college
students who battle their parents and each other over sex, drugs and
the Vietnam War.
   ``I was 19 in 1969. It was a fulcrum time for me,'' said
Thompson, who was a student at American University at the time. ``I
think it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a
man to try to write about something that happened in my youth.''
   ``Running on Empty'' takes place in the '80s but the '60s are
much in evidence. Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play anti-war
activists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to
live underground with their two children.
   Naomi Foner, who wrote ``Running on Empty'' and also served as
the film's executive producer, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., the
daughter of sociologists. Her own experiences made Foner well
qualified to give ``Running on Empty'' its strong political theme.
   ``I lived through that time and I've wanted to find the right way
to present it to this generation,'' said Foner, a member of the
radical Students for a Democratic Society while attending graduate
school at Columbia University.
   Foner, who also taught in Harlem's Head Start program and helped
register voters in South Carolina, said many young people are
curious about what happened in the '60s.
   ``A lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were
sorry to have missed,'' she said.
   Brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of
the general public: ``The principle impact of the media is that they
reflect the values of the larger society.
   ``Film is a very powerful art medium,'' he said. ``I believe it
very accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming
trends. It's because film writers, like other writers, are
perceptive people. They get the message of what's going on.''

   For students working in a miniature factory at
the University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business is
now.
   ``When our students go into industry, they will have
state-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions about
expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the
workplace, said Sema Alptekin, designer of the futuristic business
laboratory.
   Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs
the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging
laboratory.
   The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the
only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced
such programs in the country.
   Tom Akas of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers said Ms.
Alptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... Students
can see how the factory of the future operates.''
   The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms.
Alptekin as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer.
   In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from
storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent,
4-foot metal sentry. The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on a
pivoting base. The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and
turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. The
robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe
or milling machine.
   The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court. The
machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting
shops, Ms. Alptekin said.
   Students learn to program a computer and automated machines
linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation _ retrieving raw
materials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed to
supply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing the
parts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into
finished products at the lathe.
   Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key
chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.
   But the product is less important than the process. Ms. Alptekin
said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation
and financial consulting.
   In the factory of the future, according to the university's
model, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines.
   ``Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. Alptekin
said, referring to programming that allows components such as the
automated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controls
the manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of
parts.
   Ms. Alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even
from industries where robots and automated machines have become
almost commonplace. There, she said, robots perform specific tasks
in ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible
for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the
production line.
   Ms. Alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile
industry, but she would like to see it expanded.
   ``It should be used in any industry,'' she said. ``It's difficult
to justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can
be easily justified.
   ``At least our students will be aware of the enhancements and
developments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers
and managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.
   A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to
altering it to create a new product. Ms. Alptekin said the student
identified what new production components were necessary and
determined how they could be integrated into the system.
   A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will
allow the system to diagnose itself. The system could be programmed
to recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to
switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled
component, much as human managers would react.
   Graduate student Bob Borchelt said the equipment he is using is
on the cutting edge of manufacturing.
   ``Truthfully, I can't say that I was expecting this level of
expertise,'' he said. ``I know that our lab is one of the best of
its kind in an educational institution.''
   The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on
computing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork.
   ``For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms.
Alptekin said.
   Ms. Alptekin said she is continually fine-tuning the lab. This
past year, the original robot was replaced with one able to perform
more tasks. She now is considering purchasing a robot with vision
sophisticated enough to act as an inspector.
   The university spent $30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987. An
estimated $60,000 to $70,000 was earmarked in 1988.
   International Business Machines Corp. recently pledged $1.2
million in computer equipment and software to the university as part
of an IBM program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across the
country.
   ``Studies show that there's a severe national shortage of
instructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' said
Andy Russell, a spokesman for IBM. ``IBM will benefit because we
will be helping to train the (computer-integrated manufacturing)
workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''

   An early morning house fire killed a woman
and a firefighter who was fatally injured as he searched the house,
officials said Saturday. Four other members of the woman's family
were injured.
   Fire Investigator Ray Mauck said the 4 a.m. fire started in the
front room of the house in northwest Wichita but he would not
comment on the cause. ``We are fairly sure at this time that it was
an accidental fire,'' he said.
   Killed were Tilda Sue Price, 53, and firefighter C.C.
Killingsworth, 39, a 17-year veteran of the Wichita Fire Department.
   Mrs. Price's husband, Everett Price, 63, and their daughters,
Corine, 22, and Valrie, 16, escaped and were in serious condition
Saturday night at St. Francis Regional Medical Center, hospital
officials said. Another firefighter was treated for minor injuries
and released.
   Killingsworth's colleagues praised him a dedicated firefighter.
   ``He was a very aggressive firefighter. He loved the work he was
in,'' said acting Fire Chief Larry Garcia said. ``He couldn't be
bested in terms of his willingness and his ability to do something
to help you survive.''
   Firefighters never reached Mrs. Price, who was trapped in her
bedroom, Garcia said. They had to cut short their rescue effort just
before the roof caved in. The woman's daughters escaped from a
second-story bedroom by climbing down ladders put up on the side of
the house by firefighters.

   In the nation's capital, where the federal
government's war on drugs is mapped out, young Washingtonians
fighting over drugs were killing each other at a rate of more than
one a day during 1988.
   The District of Columbia's drug problems dramatize the two
different Washingtons _ the Capitol, the White House and other sites
visited by millions of tourists each year, and the squalid
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power.
There, a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn
to the status and money that come from selling drugs.
   In 1988, 371 persons had been killed in the nation's capital as
of Dec. 30, far surpassing the previous high total of 287, set in
1969. Police blame drugs _ particularly the arrival of crack cocaine
_ for about 60 percent of the slayings. As recently as 1986,
drug-related killings accounted for just one-third of the city's
homicide total.
   Although final population and homicide figures have yet to be
compared, Washington and Detroit had the two highest per-capita
murder rates in America in 1988, meaning the nation's capital could
earn the dubious honor of being the nation's murder capital as well.
   Ironically, the absence of organized crime in Washington may be
pushing the murder total even higher. Law enforcement officials note
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug
market, there are fewer drug-related slayings.
   ``What you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting
among themselves for drug turf,'' said Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner. ``They are just working for themselves.''
   Stemming the city's drug tide has become an increasingly tough
battle for Turner and his 3,800 officers.
   Earlier this year, police switched to .9mm semiautomatic handguns
out of fear that weapons commonly found on the street were
outclassing the standard .38-caliber six-shot revolver officers have
been carrying.
   The new weapons, which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots
before reloading, were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted
in the seizure of Uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated
weaponry. Surveying the weapons at a March news conference, Turner
called the district's streets ``something out of the Wild, Wild
West.'' Officers will have their new guns by 1990.
   And police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects
hasn't sated the city's appetite for narcotics. A highly-touted
anti-drug program, Operation Clean Sweep, has produced more than
46,000 arrests since its August, 1986, inception.
   However, Turner has complained that the program, which sends
swarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make
arrests, has done little more than further clog the city's
already-overcrowded jail and court systems.
   For each drug dealer arrested, another springs forward, according
to Turner.
   ``A lot of these kids are high school dropouts, with few
skills,'' Turner said. ``They can make up to a $1 million a year
selling drugs. What would you do?''
   U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jay B. Stephens, who
can prosecute both local and federal crimes, earlier this month
announced that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work
solely on drug-related killings in the district.
   Turner has also called on city officials to spend more money on
drug education, prevention and treatment programs. Currently, a
three-week wait is common for persons wanting to enroll in the
city's treatment centers.
   What does the future hold? Police hope that as markets are more
firmly established for crack, a highly-addictive cocaine derivative,
the murder rate will decrease.
   ``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an
infusion of crack,'' Turner said. ``When crack arrived in other
cities, like New York, murder rates went up there too.''

   Revelers rang in 1989 in celebrations ranging from the neon-lit
Times Square in New York City to small square-dance halls in Indiana
and a mountaintop in Colorado, some with champagne glasses, others
promoting abstinence.
   Millions watched the traditional New Year's countdown on
television as the 600-pound wrought-iron ball descended a pole at
Times Square. An estimated 600,000 saw the 81-year-old tradition in
person.
   ``We came here because we watched this on TV every year in
California, and one day I said, `We've got to go there one of these
years,'' said Claudia Zuniga-Mora, 23, of San Diego, who was
visiting friends in New Jersey.
   A 90-minute laser light show in the nation's largest city also
was part of the festivities.
   Many celebrated without such glitz.
   In Martinsville, Ind., three square dance clubs were to do-si-do
until 1 a.m. in the 4-H Building at the Morgan County Fairgrounds.
Betty Conover, president of the Flagtown Steppers, said about 200
people were expected. No alcohol was served.
   ``Square dancers do not drink and dance. You can't drink and
listen to the caller,'' Mrs. Conover said.
   Members of the AdAmAn Club of Colorado Springs, Colo., chose a
more solitary setting to toast 1989. They lit a fireworks display
from the top of Pikes Peak, elevation 14,100 feet.
   The group's 66th annual trek culminated at midnight with 60 giant
starbursts exploding over the snowcapped peak, where temperatures
dipped to about zero and hikers encountered 50 mph winds.
   ``It was difficult going above tree line where the snow depth
reached thigh level,'' said Jim Bates, who made his 34th climb..
   Music played a role in many celebrations. At the Grand Ballroom
in the New Orleans Sheraton, the music of the Guy Lombardo Orchestra
and swing were king.
   ``We're still playing the music Guy Lombardo played,'' said Kenny
Leighton, the leader of the Guy Lombardo Orchestra. ```The sweetest
music this side of heaven.' Isn't that corny? But it's true.''
   About 1,000 people had plans to dance 1988 away at a black-tie
affair at Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   They were to step out to the theme of the Broadway musical
``Phantom of the Opera,'' said Mitchell Etess, a hotel spokesman.
   A group of New Jersey senior citizens also had partying in mind.
   Residents at the Jewish Geriatric Home in Cherry Hill planned a
New Year's party with the usual activities and even champagne.
   But the party was scheduled to last only until lights-out at 8
p.m., said spokesman Michael Bucci.
   An estimated 500,000 people jammed downtown Miami for the 55th
Annual King Orange Jamboree Parade to watch flashy floats, bands, 20
circus elephants and television stars such as George Wendt of
``Cheers'' and Susan Ruttan and Raymond Burr of ``LA Law.''
   In Boston, about a half million people wandered the city's
streets and public gardens as part of 13th annual First Night
celebration, which has inspired similar festivals in 23 cities from
Denver to Charlotte, N.C. More than 1,000 artists performed across
Boston.
   Many appreciated the event's no-drinking policy.
   ``We used to go out and misbehave like everyone else on New
Year's, but now we come to this as a family,'' said Joyce LaVecchia.
``I mean, why not? And there's no headache in the morning.''
   Drinking and driving, again, was an issue across the country.
   About 1,000 state troopers in New Jersey were on duty to
encourage motorists to stay at the 55 mph speed limit and reduce the
number of traffic accidents.
   Anheuser Busch Co. in Newark, N.J., offered free New Year's Eve
taxi rides home for about 3,000 drinking revelers in six northern
New Jersey counties, officials said.
   One group also moved to stop a dangerous New Year's Eve tradition
in Detroit.
   Save Our Sons and Daughters, which is made up of relatives and
friends of slain Detroit children, asked residents to end the city's
New Year's Eve skyward shooting spree.
   For several years, at midnight, some residents have shot guns in
the air.
   ``It's an insane practice, a part of the mores of this community
that needs to stop,'' said Fred Williams, a spokesman for the
Detroit Police Department.
   And in Philadelphia, one group eschewed making resolutions.
Instead, they issued predictions _ for last year.
   The Procastinators Club of America released its 1988 New Year
predictions Saturday, as usual when the year is ending.
   ``Somehow,'' said club president Les Waas added, ``we've never
been wrong.''
   The club's No. 1 prediction was that George Bush would be elected
president and then shoot quail over the Christmas holidays while
vacationing in Texas.
   ``That was a real shot in the dark but it was bull's eye,'' Waas
said.

   Illegal fireworks injured hundreds of
people and ignited six fires in Manila, leaving thousands of
families homeless in the New Year, police and doctors said Sunday.
   Hospital officials said seven people died from stray bullets and
stabbings in New Year's celebrations and brawls in Manila and the
city of Cebu, 360 miles southeast of Manila.
   A check with doctors at 20 government and private hospitals in
the capital area showed 1,134 people were injured, mostly by
fireworks, late Saturday and early Sunday.
   ``It's like a war zone here,'' said a government doctor who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Fingers are being amputated. People are
wounded by stray bullets. They are still coming in, and our records
are still in shambles from last night.''
   Fire raged through one slum neighborhood, killing at least one
person and destroying 3,000 makeshift houses, said arson
investigator Cpl. Edmar Espresion.
   Hundreds of houses and apartments also were burned in five other
fires in which no casualties were reported, Espresion said.
   ``All of these fires were started by firecrackers,'' Espression
said.
   In Cebu, the second largest city, at least 86 people, several of
them children, were treated in government hospitals for injuries
from firecrackers.
   In Bulacan province, north of Manila, 33 people were injured in
frenzied revelry on New Year's Eve, hospital authorities said.
   The manufacture, sale and use of firecrackers are illegal in the
Philippines. But the ban is lightly enforced in a nation where
people traditionally explode fireworks to usher in the New Year and
celebrate other festivals.
   On Friday, U.S. serviceman Sgt. Michael Kaleda, 29, of Florida,
and a 10-year-old Filipino boy were killed when a homemade
firecracker prematurely exploded in the American's house outside
Clark Air Base. Four other Filipinos were wounded in the blast.
   An explosion Thursday at an clandestine firecracker factory in
Bulacan province killed 11 people and injured 20.

   A sightseeing cruise boat crowded
with New Year's Eve revelers capsized and sank, and at least 42
people drowned, authorities said Sunday.
   A survivor said foreigners were on board, and Rio morgue
officials said they were calling foreign consulates to help identify
bodies.
   The cruise boat, a popular local sightseeing attraction called
the Bateau Mouche, was taking people to see a New Year's fireworks
display off famous Copacabana Beach.
   ``We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it
was because of excess capacity,'' said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the
Rio de Janeiro State Fire Department's Maritime Group, who
coordinated rescue work. He confirmed the figure of 42 dead and said
perhaps 130 people had been on board.
   Earlier, a radio operator for the Fire Department's Sea Rescue
Service said the Bateau Mouche had collided with a private yacht,
the Casa Branca. But Santos said the Casa Branca was simply one of
many boats that stopped to aid Bateau Mouche victims.
   Irineu Barroso, the chief of Rio's 10th Police Precinct, with
jurisdiction over the bayfront neighborhood closest to the disaster,
also said 42 people had drowned.
   ``It seems there was an excess of passengers, maybe 130 to 150 on
board,'' Barroso told The Associated Press. A local radio station
said the Bateau Mouche has a capacity of about 100. ``We understand
the boat was told to turn back but ignored the order,'' Barroso said.
   Maj. Santos said the sinking occurred at 11:45 p.m. Saturday
(8:45 p.m. EST) ``in very rough seas.''
   A Brazilian woman, who said she survived by hanging onto a
floating table, told the privately owned Globo TV network she was
with a group that included Italians and that there were other
foreigners aboard.
   The woman, whose name was not immediately available, also
verified Barroso's statement about the order to turn back. She said
Port Authority officals stopped the Bateau Mouche when it already
was out on the water, seemed to be counting passengers and made the
boat retrun to its bayfront mooring.
   But then, she said, the cruise boat simply set out again 15
minutes later.
   The Bateau Mouche makes daily sightseeing cruises across
Guanabara Bay, where tourists can admire the mountain scenery that
surrounds Rio.
   The New Year's Eve program, widely advertised in newspapers, was
to leave the bay, pass by Sugarloaf Mountain and anchor in the
Atlantic Ocean off Copacabana Beach.
   A fireworks display was set off at the beach at midnight Saturday.
   Rio's New Year's fireworks show, in the Southern Hemisphere's
summer, routinely draws 1 million people to the beach and hundreds
of small craft off shore.
   The Brazilian travel agency that operates the cruise boat,
Itatiaia Tourism, did not answer its phone early Sunday.

   An earthen dike broke early Sunday,
forcing the evacuation of an estimated 1,500 people for several
hours and closure of a major interstate highway, authorities said.
   Police said the 2,500-foot-long dike, a section of the Quail
Creek Dam on the Virgin River about 14 miles east of here, broke
eight minutes after midnight.
   The 50-foot-high dike released a wall of water 10 feet to 12 feet
high, said Mike Brunn, a member of the Washington County Search and
Rescue Team who watched the water gush through the river channel.
   ``If you had had a surfboard, you could have just rode the wave.
It was that forceful,'' Brunn said.
   No injuries were reported. Washington County sheriff's deputies
reported seeing apparently empty vehicles carried along by the
floodwaters, but there were no immediate reports of people missing.
Dispatcher Melody Murdock said deputies reported seeing two
recreational vehicles and a pickup in the river.
   St. George City Manager Gary Esplin said ``numerous'' homes were
flooded in some of the areas evacuated in the communities of
Bloomington, Bloomington Hills, Washington Fields and parts of
Washington city.
   Washington County sheriff's dispatcher Thad Mattson said about
daybreak that people were beginning to return to their homes.
   ``The water pretty well has receded down,'' Mattson said. ``It's
headed down the gorge and into the Arizona end of it. Most of the
people who have been evacuated are returning.''
   Esplin said three bridges in St. George and Washington city were
destroyed or rendered useless.
   St. George Police Chief John Pollei said water was pouring
through an ever-widening gap in the dike, which contains Quail Creek
Reservoir on the south side. He said the dam itself, which is also
earthen and faces southeast, was not damaged.
   The high water forced the closure of Interstate 15 _ the main
route between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles _ south of St. George
where the freeway enters the narrow Virgin River Gorge. The break is
located about 250 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   Utah Highway Patrol dispatcher Shirley Iker said there was no
water on the road, but travel through the winding gorge was
considered hazardous. Mattson said the road would be closed until
later in the day when state officials would inspect a bridge running
over the Virgin River as a precaution.
   Iker said the Nevada Highway Patrol had blocked traffic from
approaching the gorge from the south, and Arizona authorities had
set up roadblocks on side roads that access the passage.
   The south end of the gorge is in Arizona, a few miles from the
Nevada border.
   The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning for
areas along the river southward from the dam to the Arizona border.
   Pollei said the Virgin River Bridge on Utah 9 below the dam was
completely under water, severing the highway between the towns of
St. George and Hurricane.
   The cause of the break was not known, he said. A leak was noticed
in the dike as early as 10 p.m.
   Pollei also said he had no precise figure on how many homes had
been evacuated. However, local Mormon Church authorities opened
their chapels to evacuated families and local Red Cross officials
appealed to community residents to open their homes to the displaced.
   Congested traffic was reported on Utah 9 west of the bridge and
on local arteries between Bloomington and St. George as residents
attempted to move their families and livestock out of harm's way.
   Officials said the evacuation effort initially was hampered by
the New Year's holiday. Some residents assumed the city's civil
defense siren was being sounded to herald the new year. Also, many
residents were away from their houses when authorities ordered the
evacuation.
   The flood knocked radio station KSGI off the air. The station's
transmission tower was only 50 feet from the river, said news
director Jules Dinoff.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Male Prime Ministers May Eventually Be Fashionable
Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who made history
in 1979 when she became Europe's first woman prime minister, noted
Sunday she is not alone and joked that male politicians may one day
come back into fashion.
   ``We're getting more women prime ministers,'' she said in a
television interview, referring to the recent election of Benazir
Bhutto as prime minister of Pakistan.
   ``And don't forget ... Mrs. Gandhi was a very able, charming,
formidable prime minister of India.''
   Mrs. Thatcher now is the longest serving leader in the West.
Before she came to power, women had governed in Sri Lanka and
Israel. Part of the British leader's tenure in office coincided with
that of Mrs. Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1984.
   ``I think male prime ministers one day will come back into
fashion,'' she joked with interviewer David Frost on Britain's
commercial TV-am channel.
   Asked about combining her job and her domestic life with her
husband, Denis, a retired oil executive, she said ``women have run
both the home and work for a very long time.''
   ``I mean, every working wife knows that if you decide to have
steak and kidney pie for supper, it's no better if you took 20
minutes thinking about it than if you took 20 seconds.''
   Frost recalled Mrs. Thatcher's comment ``I never did understand
men,'' during an acrimonious meeting last year with fellow leaders
of the European Economic Community. Asked if she understood men
better now, Mrs. Thatcher replied:
   ``It may not be understanding of the deepest kind, but I do know
what they're likely to do and say. So, one has a certain
predictability about it.''
